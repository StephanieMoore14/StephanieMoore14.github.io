            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I'm a data scientist who builds wearable health technology at the intersection of rigorous science and real-world performance.</p>
                <p>As a former collegiate basketball player, I’ve always been curious about the "why" behind performance. Today, I trade the court for data science, leveraging my background in biometric signals—heart rate, activity, sleep, and metabolic markers—to build products that help people understand their own bodies.</p>
                <p>My career has spanned tech startups, government consulting, and medical devices, but my sweet spot is the intersection of technical depth and human performance. I’ve worked across the entire product lifecycle, from architecting automated annotation tools for algorithm development to leading clinical data strategy.</p>
                <p>I thrive on bridging the gap between "what the sensor sees" and "what the user needs". Whether I’m collaborating with algorithm engineers to tune feature performance or synthesizing research into actionable product recommendations, I bring the same drive I had on the court to every technical challenge. I’m energized by the future of wearable tech and human performance, specifically roles that require a mix of biometric analysis, creative product strategy, and a deep understanding of how data can optimize the user's journey.</p>
                <p>If you’re building the next generation of data-informed health and performance products, let’s connect!</p>
