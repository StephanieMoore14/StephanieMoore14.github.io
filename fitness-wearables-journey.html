            <h1 class="blog-title">My Journey Through Fitness Wearables</h1>
            <p class="blog-subtitle">From college basketball to jiu-jitsu mats—how I went through four different wearables trying to find the one that actually fit my life</p>
        </header>

        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>It’s no secret there are an overwhelming amount of options for fitness wearables these days. And if you ask ten people which one is the best, you'll probably get ten different answers. Apple Watch. Garmin. Oura. Fitbit. Whoop...</p>

            <p>I've been on my own winding path through the wearable tech landscape, and honestly? It's been a journey of trial and error, figuring out what actually matters to <em>me</em>. Not what the marketing says. Not what the influencers are talking about. Just... what works for the way I actually live and move.</p>

            <p>So let me take you through it.</p>

            <h2>The Beginning: Catapult and College Basketball</h2>

            <p>My first real introduction to wearable fitness tech wasn't even something I bought, it was something I wore as part of a research project under the Sports Performance Program during my time as a college basketball player at UC San Diego.</p>

            <p>We were lucky enough to be one of the teams involved in using Catapult Vector devices. These things weren't exactly consumer-friendly... we wore them in the back of adaptive sports bras during practices and games, and they tracked every jump, every cut, every sprint. The data was incredibly granular: acceleration, deceleration, player load, all of it. Now, this was back in 2019 and since then, <a href="https://www.catapult.com/solutions/vector-core" target="_blank">Catapult</a> has made some pretty cool advances in the field so you should check them out!</p>

            <p>What made it especially interesting for me was that I also interned for the school’s Sports Performance department at the time. So I wasn't just generating the data, I was helping process it, building dashboards, working with force plates and other performance tech. It was my first real glimpse into how powerful wearable data could be when you actually knew what to do with it.</p>

            <p>But here's the catch: this was all high-level sports performance stuff. Not exactly something you wear to track your morning run or log a weightlifting session. When college ended, so did my access to that kind of tech.</p>

            <div class="timeline-divider">• • •</div>

            <h2>The Apple Watch Era (2020-2022)</h2>

            <p>Fast forward to 2020. I started working remotely and actually had a health and wellness subsidy through work. Like many active people during this time, I was doing more at-home workouts and outdoor activities. But I wanted to really focus more on what fitness looked like for me as a “retired” college athlete or NARP (non-athletic regular person) as they like to say. As already a member of the Apple ecosystem, I started with what I knew, the apple watch.</p>

            <div class="device-card">
                <h3>Apple Watch</h3>
                <p><strong>Primary Activity:</strong> Weightlifting</p>
                
                <div class="pros-cons">
                    <div>
                        <h4>What Worked:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intuitive interface</li>
                            <li>Great for tracking weightlifting sessions</li>
                            <li>Seamless integration with fitness/ running apps like Strava & Nike Run</li>
                            <li>Activity rings kept me motivated</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>The Deal-Breaker:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Constant notifications were overwhelming</li>
                            <li>Felt more like a phone on my wrist than a fitness tracker</li>
                            <li>The "smart" features became distracting</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Look, I know for most people, the notifications and smart features are a <em>pro</em>. But for me? It was too much. I didn't want my wrist buzzing every time someone sent me an email or a Slack message. I wanted a fitness tracker, not a second phone.</p>

            <p>So I stopped wearing it. For a while, I just... didn't track anything. And honestly, that was fine. Until I started getting curious about the stuff that wasn't just activity-based.</p>

            <div class="timeline-divider">• • •</div>

            <h2>The Ring Phase: Ultrahuman (2024)</h2>

            <p>By 2024, I was getting more interested in the bigger picture of health—sleep, recovery, stress, all the things that happen when you're <em>not</em> working out. I'd been hearing about the Oura Ring, which seemed perfect... except for that subscription fee. At the time, I just wasn't sold on paying monthly for data that should be mine anyway.</p>

            <p>Enter Ultrahuman Ring. No subscription. Solid metrics. So I gave it a shot.</p>

            <div class="device-card">
                <h3>Ultrahuman Ring</h3>
                <p><strong>Primary Activities:</strong> Weightlifting, Jiu-Jitsu</p>
                
                <div class="pros-cons">
                    <div>
                        <h4>What Worked:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No subscription model</li>
                            <li>Good sleep insights (when accurate)</li>
                            <li>Minimal, sleek design</li>
                            <li>Learned a lot about my sleep patterns</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>The Problems:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sleep tracking wasn't always accurate (missed bathroom breaks entirely)</li>
                            <li>Live activity tracking is still in Beta mode</li>
                            <li>Terrible for weightlifting—constantly had to take it off</li>
                            <li>Really not ideal with jiu-jitsu</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>After about a year and a half, I'd gotten what I could from the Ultrahuman. I understood my sleep patterns, learned some recovery basics, but the device just couldn't keep up with how I was actually moving through life.</p>

            <p>Grabbing weights with a ring on your finger? Not ideal. Rolling in jiu-jitsu with a ring? Potentially dangerous. And when your two main activities are things you can't even wear your tracker for... what's the point?</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>A note on sleep tracking:</strong> I had multiple nights where I woke up, went to the bathroom, scrolled my phone for a bit, and came back to bed. The Ultrahuman showed uninterrupted sleep. I <em>know</em> I was awake. That kind of thing erodes trust pretty quickly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-divider">• • •</div>

            <h2>Where I Am Now: Whoop</h2>

            <p>Which brings me to my current setup: Whoop.</p>

            <p>I'll be honest, I was hesitant about another subscription model. But Whoop offered a full free month trial, which gave me actual time to test it in my real life (not just a week where I'd still be figuring out how it worked). And more importantly, I’ve only worn Whoop for the first month, but so far, it has solved all the problems I'd been running into.</p>

            <div class="device-card">
                <h3>Whoop</h3>
                <p><strong>Primary Activities:</strong> Jiu-Jitsu (almost daily), Weightlifting</p>
                
                <div class="pros-cons">
                    <div>
                        <h4>What Works:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Multiple wear locations (wrist, bicep, even sports bra/ underwear)</li>
                            <li>Actually captures jiu-jitsu output accurately</li>
                            <li>Tracks the metrics I care about: strain, recovery, sleep</li>
                            <li>No screen = no distractions</li>
                            <li>Can wear it during everything (long day battery life)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>The Trade-offs:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Subscription required</li>
                            <li>Learning curve for complexity of data insights</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The game-changer for me was jiu-jitsu. I train almost every day, and it's high output—rolling, drilling, sparring. None of my previous trackers could handle it, either because I couldn't wear them safely or because they didn't register the activity properly.</p>

            <p>Whoop has different wearing options, including a bicep band and even clothing with built-in pockets (sports bra, compression shorts). I can actually wear it during training, and it actually captures what I'm doing. That alone made the switch worth it.</p>

            <p>Plus, and this is key for me: no screen. No notifications. No smart features. It's just data. I check the app when I want to, not when my wrist tells me to.</p>

            <h2>What I've Learned</h2>

            <p>After going through all of this, from research-grade sports performance tech in college to consumer wearables I've tried and abandoned, here's my latest thoughts:</p>

            <p><strong>The "best" tracker is the one you'll actually wear.</strong> Sounds obvious, but it's true. If you can't wear it during your primary activities, or if it annoys you enough that you stop using it, it doesn't matter how good the data is.</p>

            <p><strong>Know what you actually care about.</strong> Do you want activity tracking? Recovery insights? Sleep data? Notifications and smart features? Different devices excel at different things, and there's no one-size-fits-all.</p>

            <p><strong>Your needs will change.</strong> What worked for me during my weightlifting phase didn't work once I started jiu-jitsu. That's fine. It's okay to switch devices as your life and priorities shift.</p>

            <p><strong>Subscription models aren't inherently bad.</strong> I resisted them for a while, but if the device actually delivers value and fits your lifestyle, the monthly cost might be worth it. For me, Whoop's subscription is worth it because I'm using it every single day in ways that matter to me.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>I'm not here to tell you which wearable to buy. What works for me might not work for you, and that's the point! We all move differently, have different priorities, and use these things in different ways.</p>

            <p>Right now, Whoop is working for me. Will it still be my device in two years? Maybe. Maybe not. And that's okay too. What I do know is there's so much more to learn—about recovery science, about training load, about how to actually use all this data to perform better. That's the part I'm looking forward to.</p>

            <p>The journey is just getting started</p>
